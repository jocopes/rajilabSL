Q10: Use the boston dataset
To begin, load in the Boston data set. The Boston data set is
part of the MASS library in R

```{r}
library(MASS)
boston <- Boston
?Boston

```
How many rows are in this data set? How many columns? What
do the rows and columns represent?
ANS: 506 rows with 14 columns. each row is a town, each column had a measurement (ie. crime rate, rooms per dwelling, age, distance etc)

b) Make some pairwise scatterplots of the predictors (columns) in this data set. Describe your findings
```{r}
pairs(boston[1:3], pch = 16)
pairs(boston[4:7], pch = 16)
pairs(boston[8:11], pch = 16)
pairs(boston[12:14], pch = 16)
```
Some of these variables are categorical so it's not able to tell us much. An interesting pattern is seen between the lstate and the medv values. Te nox and rm variables are also worth noting.

c)
